  Thank you for installing VCMI!

  Before you can start playing, there are a few more steps that need to be completed.

  Please keep in mind that in order to use VCMI you must own the original data files for Heroes速 of Might and Magic速 III: Complete or The Shadow of Death.

  Heroes速 of Might and Magic速 III HD is currently not supported!
